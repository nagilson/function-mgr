# function-mgr: Stop Reusing Code

This is a basic code snippet manager created using C++ using VS GUI tools. 
The original project type is now deprecated in Visual Studio, so the project is discontinued and you will not be able to build it or edit it any further, unfortunately. 

## Usage

You cannot compile this program, and you must instead use the .exe file provided in the release folder.
