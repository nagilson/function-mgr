# function-mgr: Stop Reusing Code

This project was a code snippet manager created using C++ using VS GUI tools. 
Features:
* Syntax Highlighting 
* Saving Code Snippets and Copying them to clip board with correct tabs and spacings preserved
* Fast tab completion navigation.
* Editing code snippets in an IDE like window. 

Nowadays I would design everything very very differently to be more performant, extendible, and well designed, but the app still serves its functions. 

## Usage

Since the original original project type is now deprecated in the latest versions of Visual Studio, I recommend using the .exe file provided in the release folder instead of trying to build the application.
