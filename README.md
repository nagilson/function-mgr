# function-mgr 
Elementary code snippet manager that's created using Visual C++ (VS CLI Project.) 
Resx files and all other project files are NOT included. This project requires a complete rebuild from cmake (and possibly with use of ReSharpen) if you would like to edit. 

# How to use
The release folder in src provides an executable that should be easy to work with and run on a windows machine.
