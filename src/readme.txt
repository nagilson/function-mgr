# Additional Instructions and Information

#If you've recreated the project with cmake; 
* If the program cannot compile due to the compiler not finding the Boost library, select the project and go to project -> properties and then... 
go to C/C++ --> General -> Additional include directories and select a boost folder.

* Two functions found on stackoverflow have helped the development of this project by inspiration (not necessarily verbatim copy) and have been referenced at the proper function header.

* If you edit the database.txt file yourself, be weary of the conventions of how data is stored using *`s in combo with other names.
